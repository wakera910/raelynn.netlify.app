    <p>Flying up to 2,500 miles from the us and canada where they breed, all the way down to the forests in central mexico where they hibernate, the monarch’s migratory pattern is the most highly evolved of any known species of their kind. People often report seeing large numbers of monarchs flying in a clear “directional” flight, or seeing “hundreds of butterflies” nectaring in a field of flowers fueling up for the long flight. Unlike other butterflies that can overwinter as larvae, pupae, or even as adults in some species, monarchs cannot survive the cold winters of northern climates. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies leave their summer breeding grounds. It’s one of the world’s great migrations.</p>
